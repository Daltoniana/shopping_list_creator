# Shopping List Creator
A tool that transforms a meal plan with ingredients for all days of the week into a shopping list with amounts to buy. 
Customized to the way you eat. 
Zero waste.

# Use
1.  Download groceries.py
2.  Do `python groceries.py` with the required files (listed below) in the same folder as groceries.py

# Required Files
`groceries.py` needs the following three files in its folder to run:
*   a `meal_plan.xlsx` file containing a grid with ingredients for your meals; 
*   a `shopping_rules.csv` file containing all foods (ingredients) you want to include and the amounts that you use each time you prepare a meal; 
*   and a `meal_units.csv` file containing measure units (e.g. unit, lb., gr., handful, tbs...).

The output is a .txt file called "shopping list".
