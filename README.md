Zero waste.

#Features
The program feeds from three files you need to create: 
an .xlsl file containing a grid with ingredients for your meals; 
an .csv file containing all foods (ingredients) you want to include and the amounts that you use each time you prepare a meal; 
and a .csv file containing measure units (e.g. unit, lb., gr., handful, tbs...).

The output is a .txt file called "shopping list".
